    a capable-ish fighter, say would you be kind enough to lend aid to me?

  - "You see, the local gangs of thugs have grown in both size and annoyance over
    the last couple of years. The bastard even stole one of my priced bottles of
    dwarven whiskey, do you know how hard they are to get smuggled out through the
    blockade! Normally I would simply pay mercenaries to tear them a new asshole,
    but because of the war between kingdom 1 and kingdom 2 all capable ones have
    traveled for greater profit and I can\u2019t blame them for it."
  - Would you be willing to show them their place in this world? If you were to defeat
    enough of them to lure out their leader and show them how weak he really is I
    bet they would lose morale and give up their raids and if luck would have it
    some of my old workers would return.
